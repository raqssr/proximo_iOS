/// A retrier represents a "callback" that is executed whenever a request fails. One option for a
/// retrier is to retry a failed request only once. An example might be a retrier that refreshes
/// an authentication token when the server returns a 401 status code. Another option for the
/// retrier is to retry multiple times. A common example might be a retrier that "backs off"
/// exponentially long to ensure that a request is fulfilled at some time.

    /// Retries the given request that failed with the given error. Based on this information,
    /// the retrier is expected to perform any action such that the probability of the request
    /// succeeding when scheduled for the next time is increased. The function returns a future
    /// that should emit a boolean whether to actually retry the given request. When the emitted
    /// value is `true`, the request is retried immediately, otherwise, the upstream failure is
    /// propagated to the downstream subscriber immediately. As indicated by the types, the future
    /// may never fail.
