Mobile application for iOS devices that shows all the available services near the user's residence area. 
Due to COVID-19, it was declared state of emergency in Portugal so some services such as restaurants, pharmacies, post offices and others, stopped being available or changed their opening hours. In order to keep all the population informed, it was developed a website and two mobile applications (for Android and iOS). This project allows its users to be aware of all the services near their houses so they don't have to go much further and at the same time help local commerce.
The application uses location information from the device to search for the services but if the user don't want to give permission for this, he/she can choose some specific district and county.

### Features
- Search for all the services near the residence area;
- Check list of services by category (Health, Administrative Services, Banks, Supermarkets, among others);
- Check detailed information about each service;
- Change area of search (if user don't want to search near his/her house).
